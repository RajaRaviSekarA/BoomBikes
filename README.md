## General Information
- Analyse the BoomBikes data from 2018 and 2019
- Understand the demand for shared bikes among the people
- Factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
  - How well do those variables describe the bike demands
  
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The Multiple Linear Regression model
- A Linear Regression model should be built based on the total number of bike rentals (casual / registered)
- Split the data based on 70:30 ratio and evaluate the model Training dataset and Test dataset
- Perform the R² score on the test dataset (R² and Adjusted R²)
- Predict the value, Model building, and Evaluation
